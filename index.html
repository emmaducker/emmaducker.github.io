    <p> Hi, Iâ€™m Emma, a 24-year old <em> design engineer</em>. After graduating from Mechanical Engineering at <strong>Imperial College London</strong>, I pursued my studies in Design for Interaction to nurture my natural social abilities and sensitivity to my surroundings, and adopt a more human-centred approach when solving complex problems. Today, I make a priority to design meaningful interactions and enriching experiences to make a positive impact on users. </p>
    <p> Throughout my education, I learnt an essential skill - the ability to reflect systematically on project learnings and, more generally, on myself as an individual and professional. However, I found that the written aspect of reflection did not resonate with me. I prefer doing things with my hands, crafting and creating, embroidering on t-shirts as gifts for my family and friends for instance. </p>
